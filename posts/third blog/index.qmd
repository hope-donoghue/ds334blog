# UFO Sightings Investigation

## Introduction

Hello, welcome back! For this blog post, I worked with one of my friends, Hailey Quintavalle. We investigated a data set on UFO sightings reported throughout the world. A UFO is defined as an unidentified flying object. The data set is from Tidy Tuesday's post on June 20, 2023 and it contains 96,429 observations that each represent a UFO sighting reported. The data set contains UFO sightings from 1925 all the way to 2023. Follow along as Hailey and I explore how the number of UFO sightings has changed over the past century and find out which countries lead the world witht the most sightings.

The variables I will be investigating are:

| variables              | description                                          |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| reported_date_time_utc | the time and date of the sighting, normalized to UTC |
| month                  | the month the sighting occurred in                   |
| year                   | the year the sighting occurred in                    |
| state                  | the state in the US that the sighting occurred in    |
| country                | the country the sighting occurred in                 |

## Total UFO Sightings from 1990 - Present

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
ufo_sightings$Date <- as.Date(ufo_sightings$reported_date_time_utc)

ufo_sightings$Time <- format(as.POSIXct(ufo_sightings$reported_date_time_utc), format = "%H:%M:%S") 
 
ufo_sightings$year <- format(as.Date(ufo_sightings$Date, format="%Y/%m/%d"),"%Y")

ufo_sightings$month <- format(as.Date(ufo_sightings$Date, format="%Y/%m/%d"),"%m")

```

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
# filter out white space where line is at 0
ufo_sightings_year <- ufo_sightings %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(n_count = n()) %>%
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year)) %>% 
  filter(year > 1990)

top_year <- ufo_sightings_year %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(n_count = max(n_count)) %>%
  filter(year == "2014")
```

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
# count of ufos over the years
ggplot(data = ufo_sightings_year, aes(y = n_count, x = year)) + geom_line(linewidth = 1, color = "cornflowerblue") + theme_minimal() + scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1990, 2025, by = 5)) + labs(x= "\nYear", y = "Total UFO sightings\n", title = "Number of UFO Sightings from 1990 - Present", caption = "Data Source: National UFO Reporting Center") + geom_point(data = top_year, aes(x = year, y = n_count), size = 3, color = "red") + geom_text(data = top_year, aes(label = "6,845 sightings in 2014"), position = position_dodge(width = 1), hjust =  -0.1, size = 3.8) + theme(legend.position = "none", plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"), axis.text=element_text(size = 11),
axis.title=element_text(size = 11))
```

This line plot displays the total UFO sightings reported in the world from 1990 through 2023. The original data set that we had included UFO sightings from 1925 through 2023. However, Hailey and I decided to solely focus on the trend in the total number of UFO sightings from 1990 through 2023 because 1990 was the year that the UFO sightings started to drastically increase. We also wanted to eliminate unnecessary ink space, so we shortened the range of years. From the plot, we can see that there was a relatively increasing trend in the number of UFO sightings from 1990 to 2014. We see that 2014 had the highest number of UFO sightings reported at 6,845 sightings. It is interesting to note that after the peak number of sightings was reached in 2014, the number of sightings drastically decreased to less than 3000. There was a little increase in the UFO sightings reported in 2020, but ever since then the number of sightings reported have been declining. Do you think the number of sightings will continue to decrease in the future or will we see an increase again?

## Top 10 Countries with Highest Number of UFO Sightings

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
places_fixed <- places %>%
  mutate(country = recode(country, "Usa" = "United States", "USA" = "United States", "Guyana, South America" = "Guyana", "Hong Kong SAR" = "Hong Kong", "ITALY" = "Italy",
"Japan (Okinawa)" = "Japan", "Kazakstan" = "Kazakhstan", "Kenya (East Africa)" = "Kenya", "Luxemburg" = "Luxembourg", "Macedonia (FYROM)" = "Macedonia", 	
"Mauritius Island" = "Mauritius", "Moldova (Republic of )" = "Moldova", "Myanmar (Burma)" = "Myanmar", "Netherlands The" = "Netherlands", "New Zealand -Taranaki" = "New Zealand", "Nigeria ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¬" = "Nigeria", "PUERTO RICO" = "Puerto Rico", "Panama Canal Zone" = "Panama", "Puerto Rico Commonwealth" = "Puerto Rico", "Republic of Macedonia" = "Macedonia", "Republic of Panama" = "Panama", "Republic of South Africa" = "South Africa", "Russian Federation" = "Russia", "Slovak Republic" = "Slovakia",
"Sri lanka" = "Sri Lanka", "Trinidad" = "Trinidad and Tobago", "Trinidad/Tobago" = "Trinidad and Tobago", "US Virgin Islands" = "U.S. Virgin Islands", "	
Viet Nam" = "Vietnam", "Western Australia" = "Australia", "canada" = "Canada", "finland" = "Finland", "great britain" = "Great Britain", "south africa" = "South Africa", "turkey" = "Turkey", "united kingdom" = "United Kingdom", "usa" = "United States", "CZECH republic" = "Czech Republic", "Croatia (Hrvatska)" = "Croatia", "Czech republic" = "Czech Republic", "Dominican republic" = "Dominican Republic", "Republic of Ireland" = "Ireland", "Viet Nam" = "Vietnam", "Germany (West Germany)" = "Germany", "West Germany" = "Germany", "United Arad Emirates" = "United Arab Emirates")) %>%
  select(country) %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) 

```

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
top_10_countries <- places_fixed %>% 
  arrange(desc(count)) %>%
  slice(1:10) 

  ggplot(data = top_10_countries, aes(x = fct_reorder(country, count), y = count)) +
  geom_segment(aes(xend = country, yend = 0), linewidth = 1.2, color = "seagreen") + 
  geom_point(size = 1.8) + 
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(y = "\nNumber of UFO Sightings",
       x = "Country",
       caption = "Data Source: National UFO Reporting Center",
       title = "Top 10 Countries with Highest Number of UFO Sightings") +
  theme(axis.text=element_text(size = 11),
        axis.title=element_text(size = 12), 
        legend.position = "none", plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"))
```

This lollipop plot shows the top 10 countries in the world with the highest number of UFO sightings reported. It is not even close how far ahead the United States is compared to the other countries in the top 10. The United States have close to 12,500 UFO sightings reported, while the second closest country has not even 1,000 sightings reported.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
world_population_data <- read_csv(here("Data/world_population_data.csv"))
```

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
new_dataset_population <- left_join(places_fixed, world_population_data)
```

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
scaled_count <- new_dataset_population %>%
  mutate(scaled = count / `2022`)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
scaled_count %>% arrange(desc(count)) %>% slice(1:10) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(country, scaled), y = (scaled)*100000)) +
  geom_segment(aes(xend = country, yend = 0), linewidth = 1.2, color = "indianred") + geom_point(size = 1.8) + 
  coord_flip() + 
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(y = "\n Number of UFO Sightings per 100,000 people",
       x = "Country",
       caption = "Data Source: National UFO Reporting Center, World Population Review",
       title = "Scaled: Top 10 Countries with Highest Number \n of UFO Sightings") +
  theme(axis.text=element_text(size = 11),
        axis.title=element_text(size = 12), 
        legend.position = "none", plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"))
```

This lollipop plot is similar to the one above but now takes into account the population of each of the countries in relation to the number of UFO sightings reported. The data is now scaled to represent the number of UFO sightings per 100,000 people in each of the countries. Hailey and I decided to scale the data because we could not differentiate between the points in the plot above as they were very close to one another. This plot still shows that the United States leads the world with the highest UFO sightings per 100,000 people at roughly 3.6. However instead of the United Kingdom being in second, we see that Canada is in second with roughly 1.3 UFO sightings reported per 100,000 people.

## UFO Sightings Across the US

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
places_usa <- places |> filter(country == "USA") |> group_by(state) |> summarise(n = n())

state_df <- ggplot2::map_data("state")
state_stats <- state_stats |> mutate(state = str_to_lower(state))
state_full <- left_join(state_df, state_stats, by = c("region" = "state"))

places_usa_sum <- left_join(places_usa, state_full, by = c("state" = "abbr"))

```

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = places_usa_sum, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(color = "black", aes(fill = n), linewidth = 0.8) +
  coord_map(projection = "albers", lat0 = 39, lat1 = 45) +
  theme_void() +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = "Number of\nReports") +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.9,0.5)) +
  labs(title = "Number of UFO Sightings Reported Across the US",
       caption = "Data Source: National UFO Reporting Center") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"))


```

This map of the United States depicts the total number of UFO sightings reported state by state. The map excludes Hawaii and Alaska. Hailey and I wanted to further investigate the United States because they led the world with the most sightings. From the map we see that California has the highest number of UFO sighting reported at roughly 800. Texas, Pennsylvania and New York are close behind with roughly 600 sightings reported. On the other hand, Nevada, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota and Vermont seem to have the lowest reported sightings at roughly less than 200.

## Wrap-Up

Overall in this blog post, Hailey and I explored how the number of UFO sightings reported has changed over the past century. We found that there was a drastic increase in the number of sightings from 1990 to 2014. Ever since then, there has been a steady decline in the number of sightings reported. It would be interesting in a further project to investigate why this is the case and why there was such a sharp increase in the number of sightings in the time period between 1990 and 2014. In addition to investigating the trend of sightings over time, Hailey and I also looked at which countries in the world had the highest reported sightings. We found that the United States has an overwhelmingly high number of reported sightings in comparison to other countries. Additionally, when we just looked at the United States, we saw that California is the state with the highest number of reported sightings. Like mentioned above, it would be interesting to further look into why California has the highest number of sightings and whether or not all the sightings are coming from one specific area.  Also if we had more time, Hailey and I would have liked to include Hawaii and Alaska in the map of the United States. 

In general, we believe that our visualizations are effective at presenting the data that we had and the questions that we wanted to get answered. We decided to use a line plot to show the trend of sightings reported over time because time was one of our variables and a line plot is appropriate with time series data. Additionally, we initially wanted to do a world map that displayed the countries with the highest number of sightings reported, but the map was very confusing to read as not all countries were included in the data set and plotted respectively on the map. We learned in class that even if the data is spatial, that does not mean that a map is the best way to display the data. This is the reason why we decided to use a lollipop plot instead of a map because it highlights more easily (in descending order) the top 10 countries and their total UFO sightings. The lollipop plot also shows that even when scaling by population size, the United States is still far ahead of other countries with regards to the total UFO sightings. Finally, we decided to use a map to display the different sightings reported state by state in the United States because a map in this scenario effectively displays the information and helps improve the readability. We decided to use a continuous color scale instead of binning because we wanted to see the various differences between states on a gradient scale rather than having all the states be one of 4 colors. 

Thanks for reading!
