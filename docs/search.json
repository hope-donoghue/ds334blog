    "text": "Hello, welcome back! As an avid Premier League fan myself, I could not pass up the opportunity to investigate some Premier League data from the 2021-2022 season. This was a memorable season as the title race came down to the final match day with Manchester City claiming the crown over Liverpool by 1 point! The data set comes from Tidy Tuesday’s post on April 4, 2023 and it contains 380 observations. Each season consists of 380 games, where each of the 20 teams play 38 games (every team plays each other both home and away). The bottom three teams that get the lowest amount of points get relegated to the Championship League, which is the league below the Premier League. In this blog post, I will be focusing on visualizing statistics relating to goals! Follow along as I explore how many goals were scored each month, which teams scored the most goals, which teams gave up the most goals and which teams had the highest shot conversion rates!\n Click here for data set \nThe variables I will be investigating are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvariables\ndescription\n\n\n\n\nteam\nthe team name\n\n\nmonth\nthe month the game took place in\n\n\ngoals\nthe number of goals a team scores in a match\n\n\ngoals_against\nthe number of goals a team gives up in a match\n\n\nshots\nthe number of shots a team has in a match\n\n\nshots_on_target\nthe number of shots on goal that a team has in a match\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis lollipop plot displays in chronological order the months in the season and the total goals scored in that month by all of the teams. The season starts in early August and ends in early May. It is clear from the plot that December was the month with the highest number of goals scored at 104. April was close behind in second place with 100 goals scored. I am not surprised that those two months had the highest number of goals scored. December has the highest number of games played in a month since it is the festive period with the holidays, so with more games there is the opportunity to score more goals. Additionally, I hypothesize that a lot of goals were scored in April because it is almost the end of the season and the regulation battle along with the final push for the championship kicks in and teams are extra motivated to score more goals. From the plot, we also see that five months of the season (August, September, November, January and March) had roughly the same number of goals scored around 60 goals. This is interesting and makes me wonder whether the high number of goals scored in December and April are unusual or typical in a given season. This would be interesting to further investigate with data from past seasons!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis error bar plot shows the average goals scored per game by each team in the Premier League season in 2021-2022. We see that Manchester City and Liverpool lead the league with approximately over 2.5 goals scored per game. This plot is reflective of the final results from the season because Manchester City came in first place and Liverpool came in second place. It seems like for the 2021-2022 season, teams needed to average scoring at least 1 goal per game to avoid regulation. The bottom three teams averaged scoring less than 1 goal per game and consequently they got relegated to the Championship League.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis error bar plot depicts the average number of goals that a team concedes per game in the 2021-2022 season. From the plot, we see that Norwich gave up the most goals per game with approximately 2.25 goals. It is not surprising that this plot is opposite to the plot above that shows the average number of goals that a team scores in a game. We see that the teams that got relegated had higher average number of goals conceded per game, while Manchester City who won the league conceded on average the fewest amount of goals in the league.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeam\nTotal Goals\nTotal Shots on Target\nConversionRate\n\n\n\n\nMan City\n99\n254\n38.98\n\n\nWest Ham\n60\n158\n37.97\n\n\nLiverpool\n94\n256\n36.72\n\n\nLeicester\n62\n169\n36.69\n\n\nChelsea\n76\n211\n36.02\n\n\nTottenham\n69\n198\n34.85\n\n\nCrystal Palace\n50\n147\n34.01\n\n\nAston Villa\n52\n162\n32.10\n\n\nBrentford\n48\n154\n31.17\n\n\nEverton\n43\n138\n31.16\n\n\nArsenal\n61\n197\n30.96\n\n\nMan United\n57\n187\n30.48\n\n\nNewcastle\n44\n148\n29.73\n\n\nWolves\n38\n136\n27.94\n\n\nBrighton\n42\n152\n27.63\n\n\nLeeds\n42\n154\n27.27\n\n\nBurnley\n34\n125\n27.20\n\n\nWatford\n34\n127\n26.77\n\n\nSouthampton\n43\n170\n25.29\n\n\nNorwich\n23\n109\n21.10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis bar plot shows the shot conversion rate by each team in the 2021-2022 season. Shot conversion rate is defined as the percentage of total goals a team scores divided by the total number of shots on target that a team has. This metric shows how effective a team is at scoring, with higher percentages meaning that when a team shoots, they will most likely score. From the plot, we see that Manchester City has the highest shot conversion rate of close to 40%. On the other hand, we see that Norwich has the lowest shot conversion rate of just over 20%.\n\n\n\nIn this blog post, many statistics surrounding goals were revealed in various visualizations. My personal favorite was the bar plot showing the shot conversion rate by each team because I found it fascinating how the top teams in the league had close to a 40% conversion rate. That number is pretty high and shows how the top teams that win the league score goals when given the chance to! If I had more time and more data, I would love to add the names of players who scored each of the goals in the season. I would love to see which players scored the most goals and to also see which months they tended to score more goals in and whether a pattern existed.\nOverall, I really enjoyed data wrangling and creating visualizations with this data set. I liked how I had data from each match, so I could add the variability of the data to the error bar plots examining average goals scored and average goals conceded. I wasn’t able to do this with the previous holiday rating data set and I am glad that I was able to do this here. We learned in class that adding variability to a bar plot or to a lollipop plot allows the reader to see the distribution shape, sample size and any outliers that may be obscuring the data. With the error bars for example, you can see that Manchester City’s upper bound for goals scored and lower bound for goal scored is much larger than the other teams. You would not be able to tell this fact without the error bars added to the plot. In general, I believe that all of my visualizations effectively communicate the information because they are free of clutter, readable and informative. For example, I included text that displays the actual number of goals scored per month in addition to the scale on the x-axis because I think it helps with readability. I also added a table to display the total number of shots on target and the total number of goals scored by each team because it helps show the sample size for the shot conversion rate plot.\nThanks for reading!"

    "text": "Hello, welcome to my first blog post! Although it is February and the holidays are officially over, it is never too early to start researching the best holiday movies to watch when the holidays come next! In this blog post, I am going to be exploring a holiday movies data set from Tidy Tuesday’s post on December 12, 2023. This data set is from IMDb movie ratings and it has 800 observations (movies). Follow along as I explore which movies in the data set are rated the highest and which movies are rated the lowest. I will also be looking at whether or not holiday movies have become more popular over the past century.\nhttps://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2023/2023-12-12/readme.md\nThe variables I will be investigating are:\n\n\n\nvariables\ndescription\n\n\n\n\nprimary_title\nthe title of the movie\n\n\nruntime_minutes\nhow long the movie is in minutes\n\n\nyear\nthe year the movie was released\n\n\naverage_rating\nthe average rating of the movie out of 10\n\n\nnum_votes\nthe number of votes a movie received\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis line plot displays the number of holiday movies created over time from 1925 through 2023. It is clear from the plot that within the past two decades, the number of holiday movies have skyrocketed from less than 10 a year to close to 80. The year that made the most holiday movies seems to be 2021 with roughly 78. It is interesting how there is a dip after 2021 in the number of holiday movies made. In 2023, only 43 holiday movies were created. Are holiday movies losing popularity and on a downward trend for the future? We will not know the answer to that question for at least a few years, but it will interesting to follow and see if that happens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich movies should you definitely add to your list to watch? Look no further! This lollipop plot displays the top ten highest rated holiday movies that received more than 1000 votes by users. With an average rating of 8.1, “A Christmas Carol” also known as “Scrooge” from 1951 is the top rated holiday movie. A close second with a rating of 8.0, is “Roman Holiday” from 1953. Interestingly enough, all of the movies that made the top ten are from the 20th century. My personal favorite is “White Christmas,” so I was happy to see that movie made the top ten.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis lollipop plot displays the top ten worst rated holiday movies that received more than 1000 votes. Be sure to avoid these movies as they received the lowest average ratings. The worst movie on the list is “Kirk Cameron’s Saving Christmas” from 2014 with an average rating of 1.3 out of 10.\n\n\n\nIn this blog post, the best and worst holiday movies were revealed along with a potentially alarming trend that holiday movies might be losing popularity in the coming years given the decrease in the number of movies made in 2023. Granted this decline in holiday movies might be due to the fact that there was a Writers Guild of America strike from May to September 2023 that halted film-making. However, we cannot be certain of this fact until we see how many holiday movies are created in 2024 and compare the numbers.\nNevertheless, I really enjoyed making this blog post and wrangling the data to create these three visualizations. I was limited to a lollipop plot for displaying the best and worst holiday movies because I only had one row that corresponded to a particular movie. In this case, I was given the average rating for a movie and I was not able to calculate the average rating myself given all the information from the votes. I wish I had the original raw data because I would have added error bars or done a boxplot to show the variability that exists within the data and the potential outliers. In class, we learned about the importance of displaying the variability and distribution shape in a visualization. I feel like displaying the variability in the data would have helped me better understand the data to see if any outliers are influencing the average rating. In light of this, I tried to make the lollipop plot clear and easy to interpret. I included text that displays the actual rating in addition to the scale on the x-axis because I think it helps with readability. I also decided to start the x-axis at 0 because average rating is a length variable. In class, we learned that when displaying length, the axis should start at 0. Additionally, I decided to use a line plot to show the trend in holiday movie counts over time because a line plot displays time-series the best.\nThanks for reading!"
